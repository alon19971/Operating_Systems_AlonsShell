# Alon's Shell - Operating Systems Assignment

Alon's Shell is a custom, lightweight command-line interface designed as an assignment for an Operating Systems course. This project aims to replicate some of the basic functionalities of traditional Unix shells, with support for commands like `cd`, `cp`, `echo`, and file manipulation, along with custom features developed specifically for this assignment.

## Features

- Basic command execution: `cd`, `cp`, `echo`, `move`, `delete`, and more.
- File manipulation: Ability to create, read, append to, and move files within the file system.
- Input/output redirection: Support for redirecting command outputs to files.
- Piping commands: Allows combining multiple commands, passing the output of one as input to another.
- Custom command parsing: Handles complex inputs, including those with spaces or encapsulated within quotes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)

### Installation
